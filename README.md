# Robot dream project

## Problem

The project is dedicated to the integration of the simulated mammalian brain developed in [NeuCogAr project](https://github.com/research-team/neucogar) with robotic embodiment. One of the options of robotic embodiment is presented by the [Memristive brain project](https://github.com/research-team/memristive-brain).

During the [NeuCogAr](https://github.com/research-team/neucogar) project we have managed to reimplement several basic emotinal states: fear-like, disgust-like based on two dopamine and serotonin subsystems. Later we have added noradrenaline subsystem completely implementing the ["cube of emotions" by Hugo LÃ¶vheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6vheim_cube_of_emotion).

we came to the idea of a roobtic embodiment.

Prototype implementation of an architecture suggested in Robot Dream paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03007)
