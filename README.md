# Robot dream project

## Problem

The project is dedicated to the integration of the simulated mammalian brain developed in [NeuCogAr project](https://github.com/research-team/neucogar) with robotic embodiment. One of the options of robotic embodiment is presented by the [Memristive brain project](https://github.com/research-team/memristive-brain).

When we have managed to implement two basic emotional states (affects) in [NeuCogAr](https://github.com/research-team/neucogar) project specifically: fear-like and disgust-like states we came to the idea of a roobtic embodiment.

Prototype implementation of an architecture suggested in Robot Dream paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03007)
